  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    Mercedes Santana is a Haute Couture fashion designer with more than 30 years
    of experience. I conducted an interview to gather her business and
    customer needs, wants, and pain points. With this information, I redesigned
    and developed a new website that best reflected her brand identity and
    values. I implemented responsive design principles to ensure a seamless user
    experience across various screen sizes.
