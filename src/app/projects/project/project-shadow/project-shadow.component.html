  <h2>User Flows</h2>
  <p>
    I joined the team late in the Prototype phase. It was very important for me throughout this project to understand the flow
    of the pages from the user's perspective. The following diagrams are how I interpreted the flow of the application in order for me to complete high fidelity prototypes.
    <br />
    (*the final flow and details about other further developments are kept secret ü§´).

    <figcaption>Caption: Two flow charts are shown. The top one is for the Login and Sign Up flow. It starts at the splash screen where a user chooses to 
      register or login to their account. If they register, they must input their personal and banking information, allow or disallow notifications,
    and view Terms and Conditions. If they accept the terms/disclaimer, they can log into their new account.
  <br>
  The bottom one is for the Deposit Money flow. The user starts at the landing page where they click an "Add Money" button. They are shown a screen
  where they input a dollar amount, submit, and then go to a confirmation page.

  <h2>Design System: Colors and Typography</h2>
  <p>
    The following typeface was chosen by the head UI/UX
    Designer, for which I had to implement into my designs. The team decided on a dark color scheme for our screens.
    The following color styles on Figma informed my designs and the overall design system of the application.

  <h2>High Fidelity Prototypes</h2>

  <p><strong>Splash/Registration/Login Pages</strong></p>
  <p>
    The goal of the team was to maintain the standard sign up/login flow within my screens,
    focusing on labeling buttons for their respective functions and labeling
    inside of the text fields for accessibility.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Deposit Money Pages</strong></p>
  <p>
    The team wanted users to deposit their money in a seamless and simplified manner.
    It was important to prioritize confirmation messaging and avoid deceptive patterns so the user knows what's happening throughout this feature with their money.
  </p>

  <h2>Development</h2>
  <p>
    Finally, I spent the rest of the 3 months to bring the designs to life!
    <br>
    Project management throughout the lifecycle was handled through Trello. I met with the Senior Mobile Developer and Product Manager daily for standups. 
    In these standups, we tracked our progress, assigned tasks and their story points, and updated our backlog. 
    I integrated APIs and Flutter widgets to develop the first MVP of the application. Screens and features I worked on include the screens for the Login/Registration flows, the Profile page, and a Reset Password feature.
