  <h2>User Flows</h2>
  <p>
    I joined the team late in the Prototype phase. I sought to understand the
    user's experience, particularly the flow of the pages. The following
    diagrams depict how I interpreted the application flow, which aided in the
    completion of high-fidelity prototypes.
    <br />
    (*the final flow and details about other further developments are kept
    secret ü§´).

      Caption: Two flow charts are shown. The top one is for the Login and Sign
      Up flow. It starts at the splash screen where a user chooses to register
      or login to their account. If they register, they must input their
      personal and banking information, allow or disallow notifications, and
      view Terms and Conditions. If they accept the terms/disclaimer, they can
      log into their new account.
      <br />
      The bottom one is for the Deposit Money flow. The user starts at the
      landing page where they click an "Add Money" button. They are shown a
      screen where they input a dollar amount, submit, and then go to a
      confirmation page.

  <h2>Design System: Colors and Typography</h2>
  <p>
    The head UI/UX Designer chose the following typeface, which I then
    implemented into my designs. Additionally, we opted for a dark color scheme
    for our screens. The color styles on Figma, detailed below, informed both my
    designs and the overall design system of the application.

  <p><strong>Splash/Registration/Login Pages</strong></p>
  <p>
    Our goal was to develop an accessible screen design while maintaining the
    standard sign-up/login flow. We accomplished this by focusing on labeling
    buttons for their respective functions and labeling inside text fields.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Deposit Money Pages</strong></p>
  <p>
    We prioritized confirmation messaging and avoided deceptive patterns
    to provide a seamless, simplified process for users to deposit money.
  </p>

  <h2>Development</h2>
  <p>
    Finally, I spent the rest of the 3 months to bring the designs to life!
    Project management throughout the lifecycle was handled through Trello. I
    met with the Senior Mobile Developer and Product Manager daily for stand-ups.
    In these stand-ups, we tracked our progress, assigned tasks and their story
    points, and updated our backlog. I integrated APIs and Flutter widgets to
    develop the first MVP of the application. Screens and features I worked on
    include the screens for the Login/Registration flows, the Profile page, and
    a Reset Password feature.
